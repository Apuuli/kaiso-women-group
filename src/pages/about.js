          its mandate and the additional responsibilities given to it by UAC and
          the SCEs, UNASO develops both its own institutional capacity and the
          ones of its member ASOs and communities to enable them perform their
          functions and meet their set objectives effectively and efficiently.
          Coordination, Networking and Partnerships: In addition to being a
          membership organization with a Secretariat for coordinating all ASOs,
          UNASO also acts as the secretariat of the SCE-National NGOs and for

          8 civil society related SCEs. UNASO coordinates the national NGOs and

          order to ensure that appropriate policies, programmes, strategies and
          guidelines are in place and adequate resources are allocated, utilized
          and accounted for appropriately at both national and district levels.
          Advocacy: This programme area focuses on advocating for enabling and
          supportive environment for quality HIV and AIDS service delivery.
          UNASO builds the capacity of its district networks and ASOs so that
          they can collaboratively hold the duty bearers accountable for
          respecting, protecting and fulfilling the rights of the population
          especially in relation to HIV&AIDS by ensuring that government adopts
          and implements appropriate legal policies, national laws, institutions
          and processes. Strategic Information Management: UNASO takes
          leadership of CSOs in gathering and sharing information from domestic
          and international research efforts so that ASOs are able to access
          strategic information that is particularly relevant for HIV and AIDS
          response and benefit from such new knowledge so that they remain
          relevant to the response and UNASO to remain relevant to the members.
